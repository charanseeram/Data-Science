I know several guys have issues with pydot and graphic wizard.
Here is what you have to do it:

1. Install pydot from https://anaconda.org/rmg/pydot
2. Download graphic wizard from http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php
3. Install downloaded GRaphicWizrd
4. Add a line of code on top of the python script as below:
import os
os.environ["PATH"] += os.pathsep + 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Graphviz2.38/bin/'
This path is nothing but where you have downloaded.
5. RESTART Spyder and thing should work.
